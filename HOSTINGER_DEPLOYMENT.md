# Vanta Paper Trader — Hostinger Deployment Guide

## Overview

Vanta runs one public Express process for /api/* and /v2/*; it starts the existing Next.js frontend with next start on a private loopback port. npm run build remains next build. The API uses MySQL; market quotes and charts continue to use yahoo-finance2. Internal database IDs are CHAR(36); Polymarket condition IDs are stored separately as external keys.

## 1. Prepare the repository and hosting plan

Use the existing GitHub repository for this project. A Hostinger Business or Cloud plan with Node.js web apps is required. In hPanel, create a Node.js web app from the GitHub repository and enable deployment on push. Choose Node.js 22. Hostinger's [Node.js deployment guide](https://www.hostinger.com/support/how-to-deploy-a-nodejs-website-in-hostinger/) describes the GitHub flow and supported plans.

In build settings, use the project root, npm run build, and `server.js` as the entry file (or npm start if the panel asks for a start command). If the framework selector assumes a plain Next.js entry point, choose Other so that the Express entry file is used. Keep the Next build output .next available to the app; do not use a static export. Check the first build log to confirm the next build and Vanta Express API listening messages.

## 2. Create MySQL

In Websites → Dashboard → Databases → Management, create a MySQL database and user assigned to the site. Record the full prefixed database and user names, password, and host. Hostinger's [MySQL setup guide](https://www.hostinger.com/support/1583542-how-to-create-a-new-mysql-database-in-hostinger/) notes that names are prefixed by the hosting account. The host is usually localhost; use the value shown in hPanel. MySQL 8 is required by the JSON columns and schema syntax.

## 3. Set application environment variables

In the web app's Environment variables section, set:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| NODE_ENV | production |
| DB_HOST | Host shown for the MySQL database, usually localhost |
| DB_PORT | 3306, unless hPanel shows a different port |
| DB_NAME | Full prefixed database name |
| DB_USER | Full prefixed database user |
| DB_PASSWORD | Database password |
| CRON_SECRET | A newly generated long random secret, kept only in hPanel/private cron configuration |
| APP_URL | The site's public HTTPS origin, such as https://your-domain.example |
| NEXT_PORT | 3001 unless that private loopback port is already occupied |

Do not set old NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_* or SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY values. Database credentials and the cron secret must never be committed. Hostinger documents [environment variables](https://www.hostinger.com/support/how-to-add-environment-variables-during-node-js-application-deployment/) and [MySQL connection settings](https://www.hostinger.com/support/connecting-a-hostinger-mysql-database-to-a-node-js-application/).

## 4. Run and verify migrations

server.js runs scripts/migrate.mjs before starting the API. It applies numbered files in database/migrations/ once, records SHA-256 checksums in schema_migrations, and refuses to continue if an already applied migration was edited. The first deployment must show Applied 001_vanta_paper_trader.sql in the application log. A later restart should show no new Applied lines.

If the Node app cannot create tables, check that the MySQL user is assigned to this database with DDL rights. If Hostinger's managed app environment does not retain the project root as its working directory, set the app root to the repository root; the migration runner resolves database/migrations/ from there. The SQL files are MySQL only. supabase/migrations/ is a historical reference and must not be imported into MySQL.

After a user signs up, promote the intended first owner once in phpMyAdmin:

UPDATE users SET role = 'owner' WHERE email = 'OWNER_EMAIL_HERE';

Use the real account email only in phpMyAdmin; do not put it in a committed file. Other staff can be assigned manager. API admin routes check these database roles.

## 5. Create the four hPanel cron jobs

In Websites → Dashboard → Cron Jobs, select Custom for each job. Hostinger [schedules cron in UTC](https://www.hostinger.com/support/1583465-how-to-set-up-a-cron-job-at-hostinger/). These schedules preserve the former Vercel cron times:

| Job argument | UTC schedule | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tick | 0 13 * * * | /api/cron/tick |
| snapshot | 5 13 * * * | /api/cron/snapshot |
| predictions | 10 13 * * * | /api/cron/predictions |
| predictions-settle | 15 13 * * * | /api/cron/predictions-settle |

Each cron command calls node src/cron-handler.js JOB from the deployed project directory. That script sends Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET> to APP_URL and exits nonzero on failure. Cron jobs may not inherit the web app's environment. Put APP_URL and CRON_SECRET assignments in a private /home/USERNAME/vanta-cron.env file outside the repository and web root, and set its permissions to 600. Use the hPanel Custom command below for each job, replacing USERNAME, DOMAIN, and tick with the actual hosting values and job argument:

bash -lc 'set -a; . /home/USERNAME/vanta-cron.env; set +a; cd /home/USERNAME/domains/DOMAIN/nodejs && node src/cron-handler.js tick'

Do not paste the secret into GitHub or into this document. Check the Cron Jobs output after the first run. If the managed cron environment cannot run Node from the deployed app directory, use a custom curl command with the same Bearer header and private environment file. Hostinger documents the [managed Node app directory](https://www.hostinger.com/support/how-to-deploy-a-nodejs-website-in-hostinger/) and [Custom cron jobs](https://www.hostinger.com/support/1583465-how-to-set-up-a-cron-job-at-hostinger/).

The cron endpoints reject requests when CRON_SECRET is absent or the Bearer token is wrong. Set the same secret for the app and cron jobs.

## 6. Check the deployment

1. Open https://YOUR_DOMAIN/ and confirm the Vanta page renders.
2. Open https://YOUR_DOMAIN/health and confirm { "ok": true } (MySQL connectivity).
3. Confirm GET /api/cron/tick without authorization returns 401.
4. Sign up, sign in, and load /api/me, /api/competitions, /api/leaderboard, /api/chart?symbol=AAPL&range=1mo, and a prediction market page.
5. Place a small paper order, verify the order and fill rows in MySQL, and check the same portfolio in the Next frontend.
6. Confirm all four cron jobs show successful output.

The app uses PORT supplied by Hostinger for the public Express listener. It uses NEXT_PORT only on 127.0.0.1; do not expose that port. The app stores uploaded avatars under uploads/. Configure persistent storage or a backup for that directory if the Hostinger deployment replaces app files on each push.

## Data migration and rollback

The schema migration creates a fresh MySQL database. It does not copy rows or Supabase Auth password hashes from an existing Supabase project. If live users or paper portfolios must be retained, export and validate those records before switching DNS, map user IDs and foreign keys, and establish a password reset path. Keep the current deployment available until imported account, order, position, prediction, and leaderboard totals match. A code rollback through Hostinger GitHub deployment does not reverse database migrations; restore the MySQL backup if a database rollback is needed.
